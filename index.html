<h1>Seeking Interaction</h1>
<a href="https://flowingdata.com/2017/08/28/occupation-matchmaker/">Occupation Matchmaker</a>
<p>This website shows a visualization representing the frequency of people in certain occupations 
marrying people in the same of other occupations. There is a search bar in which you can search 
for an occupation and see which other occupations they typically marry. This is shown in bubbles/circles 
which appear as different sizes according to the frequency of marriages between the bubble/circle's 
occupation and the occupation you searched for. When you search for a new occupation, the bubbles 
<i>transition</i> to the next size, which can be done with the <i>.trasnition()</i> feature of d3, rather
than simply jumbing from one sized circle to the next from one instant to the next.</p>
